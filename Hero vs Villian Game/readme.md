Currently the game takes no input and is for a lack of better terms barebones. 
Eventually, after every round the user survives, they can choose between recovering HP, or a chance at a better weapon. (Still coming up with ideas)
In addition, after every round the user survives they will earn XP. The goal is to survive as long as possible to earn the most XP as possible.
After the run has ended, I plan on showing the top scores that has been ran on the user's computer via a local database.

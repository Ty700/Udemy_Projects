/*
* A little game I made. I plan on expanding this game in the future. 
* There isn't any user control yet, but will be able to control their actions and (if they defeat an enemy) select from rewards
* such as potion to recover lost HP, a chance at a better weapon, or other options. 
* For each enemy the hero defeats they will get earn XP and the goal is to last as long as possible to earn the most XP.
* Might add a database to hold the user's top scores in and display that after the run has ended.
